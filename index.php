            storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services

         <h2>Reasoning, Data Analysis and Writing</h2>
         <p><h4>
            Reasoning is important.  This course will teach you how to do it well.  You will learn some simple 
            but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all and some common and tempting mistakes 
            to avoid in reasoning.  We will discuss how to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other 
            people (including politicians, used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of 
            your own in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in 
            dealing with whatever matters most to you.
